The goal of the project is to reduce the amount of litter and trash around urban environments using a game-like environment. It encourages people to go around and report and/or clean up trash littering the city.
The project uses a web app to simulate a game like environment to encourage people to clean up trash. It will be crowd sourced meaning that people in the community will be actively participating in the cleaning up and posting of trash. The App would consist of 6 main screens, the login screen to authenticate the user, the menu screen to configure settings, the map to find places to clean up, the ticket request page, the ticket completion page and the leaderboard.
To request a ticket to clean up trash a user would tap the location on the map where the trash is and upload a picture and description of what needs to be cleaned up. Later on, users will see that ticket and if they clean up the trash  (or notice the trash has been cleaned up) they can tap the ticket and send a picture and description of the cleanup. The original ticket requester will then verify that the area has been cleaned up and both parties will get points on the app leaderboard. 
The leaderboard would contain the total number of points as well as number of requests and cleanups. This leaderboard would most likely reset weekly to keep it fresh. Implementing this would need a database and a server as a backend as well as access to a fuller map of the area users will clean up.
